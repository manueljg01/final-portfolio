            <p>Fauxcades's prior website had several comments expressing concern over the usabilty of the website as well as not being able to find information about products from clients. The plan called for a complete website redesign, one that showcased Fauxcades excellent services while also providing unique examples of jobs in the past. This page overs insight to my research process and overall development process concerning Fauxcades web redesign.</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
			<h4>The Need For Change</h4>
	
            <p>In the beginning of the 2020, people shifted to remote work due to the pandemic. Over two years later, many are returning to the workspace and work practices are changing from remote to hybrid. It is expected that hybrid work will be the new future but problems like inefficient use of workspace and lack of working efficiency emerge.</p>
	<br>
	
	<h2>The Redesign Process</h2>
			<h4>Initial Questions</h4>
	
            <p>The first step was to conduct in-person interviews with both the company owner and fellow event coordinators to learn their opinion on what could be improved with the website and what frustrations they had currently experienced. </p>

		 <br>
		 <h2>Brainstorming</h2>
			<p>The main problems surrounding the current Fauxcades website was that there were no specific event examples and no organization. I understood that the client wanted to see what the company could do before they would commit to a full-scale contract. For that, we developed a user flow in which we understood how the user would browse the website, from using galleries, to browsing rental items, and finally, contacting the company for a meeting.</p>

	<div class="grid-item">
		 <br>
		 <h2>Setting the framework</h2>
			<p>Each service would have its own separate page, allowing the clients a more expanded view of Fauxcades services. My team and I brainstormed and established an outline of how we wanted each page to be organized and thought about how the client would see each specific example and service-related category. This framework would establish the base line for organization when transitioning to the wireframe stage.</p>

		 <h2>Constructing the Layout</h2>
			<p>When creating the wireframes, I looked back at the research we had done with our user flow and frameworks. This stage involved bringing the team together to discuss organization practices and the best way to present the information to fit to our overall objective. Two seperate versions were created which led us to the first testing phase of the initial wireframes.</p>
		 <br>
		 <h2>The Wireframing Stage</h2>
			<p>I sent out a quick wireframe template to our client-facing teammates to quickly inquire what should be added or changed from our current website pages. The purpose of this was to discover simple improvements that could be executed quickly. The feedback we had from our initial test helped narrow our design focus and establish a more refined webpage. Some of the feedback I received was:</p>
			<br>
			<p>1. When showing images to our clients it was important to note what items Fauxcades worked on so that way the client knows how Fauxcades can elevate their event when everything is placed together.</p>
		 	<br>
			<p>2. A big feature request was the addition of more videos and descriptions of our process to further humanize the company and showcase that everyone works together as a team.</p>

		 <h2>The Soft Launch</h2>
			<p>With the testing phase of the wireframes completed, my team could move foward to the design process. For this, my team consulted heavily on the Fauxcades brand guidelines for use cases on fonts, colors, and more. The website was an extension of the Fauxcades brand, and it was critical that it was recognized as such. The website would be acting as the companyâ€™s first impression with potential clients.</p>
			 <br>
			 <p>Once I had thoroughly examined the data from our research, it was time to create a website beta. I first wanted to ensure that with the soft launch, our clients would be able to see and immediately establish that this website was distinctively Fauxcades. In addition, it was imperative that we also improved on our results from the wireframe iterations. </p>

	<div class="grid-item">
		 <br>
		 <h2>Website Development</h2>
			<p>This was one of the most challenging aspects of the entire project. In the team of three, I was the only one with experience working in front end development systems such as HTML, CSS, and Java. As a result, I was lead developer while other members of my team finalized design choices. With the project only a couple of weeks away from deadline, I readily converted our wireframes into usable code which was ready for beta testing.</p>

		 	<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>	
			<p>Unfortunately, one of our main challenges is the lack of resources and time that we had day to day to create the website. Since the original website offered no resources, all the body copy and reference images had to obtained from the company archives of events. There was no reference point to start from, so the events chosen had to presentable and easy to explain. This process took a lot of time with the team having to meticulously choose with the surplus of images and, in addition, also be able describe the company process with detail. With this challenge, we had to reiterate our designs in order to be achievable within time and technical constraints, while still providing more value to our users.</p>

	<div class="grid-item">
		 <br>
		 <h2>Final Conlusion</h2>
			<p>Overall, the complete redesign of the Fauxcades webpage was a success. We increased customer satisfaction and customer engagement across the board. Clients who have compared the two sites have expressed satisfaction over the new webpage and remarked how easy it was to use. The expanded services and increased representation of our products on the website has led to an overall increase of customer clientele with more contracts being produced and increased customer satisfaction.</p>
