                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                
            <p>In the beginning of the 2020, people shifted to remote work due to the pandemic. Over two years later, many are returning to the workspace and work practices are changing from remote to hybrid. It is expected that hybrid work will be the new future but problems like inefficient use of workspace and lack of working efficiency emerge.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The goal of this semester-long design exercise is to uncover existing user problems in hybrid working environment and propose a design solution.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Meanwhile, we gained understanding about the user, identified their needs in order to come up with rational and justified solutions to be tested and iterated through user interviews. Once we created a prototype, we quickly gathered feedback to validate or invalidate the design, iterated upon the feedback received, and tested again.</p>

            <h2>Paper Prototype</h2>
		<p>Based on the key insights and pain points derived from the user research, we started iterating various features and layouts on paper.</p>
<br>
<p>The ideation process was the most challenging part of the design process since it is a relatively new topic and few good solutions were on the market. Paper prototyping helped diversify our thinking capabilities and propose as many ideas as we could. Meanwhile, since this product is for enterprises, we also tried to follow the logic of existing apps and kept the design pragmatic.

	<h2>Prototype Testing</h2>
     <p>After we completed the wireframes, we knew it was the best time to conduct our first formal user test because wireframes clearly present our key features and UX designs and we were still making dramatic changes to the product. Therefore, we invited four peers to test our prototypes.</p>
			<br>
			<p>We identified two major problems with our initial prototype.</p>
			<br>
			<p>1. The booking process is too long to actually boost users' efficiency.
2.The calendar function causes confusions and has no difference from other calendar products.</p>
